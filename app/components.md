- idea is to create matches between people using music preferences

GENERAL APP
1. play 10 seconds of some song from a given genre
2. an accredited user can upvote/downvote that song
  - each vote is associated with a user based on their unique user login name
3. someone can view votes made by other users on their account .... you can see your past upvotes/downvotes .. a user has a page with all the songs htey like ... other users can upvote/downvote
... as time goes and the app accumulates more data, it suggwests possible matches based

WHAT WE DO WITH THE DATA
- determine most frequently voted genre for a particular user
- determine most downvoted genre for a particular user
- determine genres that pass our threshold (75% upvoted?)

CLI
- periodically, make requests to see if any data has changed on the server, if data has been added to the remote server, then update our local terminal VIEW with the new data


Holes in his description ...
- app should be a web app ...
